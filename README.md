# E-Yantra
This project is centered around the idea to develop an automated warehouse management system. The project uses Gazebo as a 3D simulation platform to simulate robots in complex environments.

The virtual environment consists of various colour-coded boxes to be delivered to different parts of the city. The order of delivery is subjected to a predefined priority order. The red coloured packages have the highest priority symbolizing medicines, the yellow coloured packages have medium priority symbolizing food and green coloured packages have the lowest priority symbolizing clothes. Two industrial robotic arms are placed at the ends of the conveyor belt.The first arm picks up the packages depending upon the priority of the orders received and places them on the conveyor belt. The second arm will collect the packages, sort them based on their colours and place them into their respective bins .The users will be notified regarding the status of their delivery once the order is placed and shipped.
